The `replace` tool is failing due to issues with exact string matching, likely caused by subtle differences in whitespace, line endings, or hidden characters when using multi-line strings in `old_string`. To ensure an accurate and complete update of the `GEMINI.md` file, I will use `write_file` to overwrite the entire file with the corrected content. This approach guarantees that all necessary changes are applied without precision issues. I will construct the full corrected content by applying all identified American English spelling changes to the original source text.
I have successfully updated the `GEMINI.md` file to reflect American English spelling conventions. All instances of "behaviour" have been changed to "behavior" and "behavioural" to "behavioral`.
